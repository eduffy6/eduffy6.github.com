	<p>	I am a  freelance photographer from Concord, MA looking to break into the photography business. I have been passionate about photography for years, but so far it has just been a hobby. I am hoping that I will be able to change that in the near future and make a career out of my love for the art of capturing lifes precious moments. 
</br>
</br>
	I have been exploring all types of photography over the years including  portraits, nature, tarvel, food, interiors, architecture, and more editorial style images. It is my belief that one becomes a stronger photographer and a more well rounded human being by exploring all that the world has to offer.</p>
